KNOWN ISSUES - BUGS:
- BBs modification. Overlapping check.
- Class names and accuracy once written look bad
- 2 pillars can potentially get generated
- Not well optimized line filtering algorithm
- NEW: results do not get returned for images where a concrete pole was not detected

SHORT TERM TASKS:
0.1 To config add what defect detectors you want to launch
0.2 Register your detector properly in the flask's app

1. Confidence is 1 for all objects
2. Add logger
3. Wood cracks?
4. Tuning:
    - Make sure preprocessing for dumper classification is correct
    - Make sure preprocessing for YOLO is correct
    - Tune YOLOs parameters (NMS, threshold etc)
    - Tune line filtering algorithm
    - Tune batch size, Qs size
5. We might want to remove NNs and workers from memory in order to get more memory for other tasks. Implement:
    - Killing workers and NNs
    - Before serving next request check if they are initialized and ready to server the request
6. Think how to collect, store and output detected defects

LONG TERM TASKS:
1. BBs interpolation. (run actual nets once in N frames as well, just remmember coordinates and then update them)
Technically, we want to run NNs only on the frames when we're running defect detection. On the frames between defect detection,
we should be doing BB interpolation: run NN once in M frames remembering objects location within the frame.
2. Object tracking (bb overlapping check suggested by Igor) - could be done right in the writer or another
worker before it. (Kinda contradicts with the above. We want to run NNs on each frame in order to be able to match objects
detected on the current frame with the objects from previous frames)

FROZENS TASKS:
- Concrete cracks module (subtract other object's boxes from the pillar BB, less noise for cracks detection).
- Missing middle pole for wooden poles
